# Vue 2 Reactivity

This poject contains JS files which aim at replicating a simple version of the reactivity system provided by Vue 2. The code has been written following a Vue 2 related reactivity course on [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/)

Since the deprecation of Vue 2, the course is not available anymore.

Reactivity has been completely redesigned in Vue, that's why this code is now obsolete. Nevertheless, it is a good way of understanding how reactivity for dependencies can be written in JS, highlighting some framework-independent patterns like the **observer pattern**, through **watchers**.
